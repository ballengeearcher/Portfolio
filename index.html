        <div class="about-sect">
        <article>
        <p>During my time as an outdoorsman I have seen technology creep into
            every aspect of my many hobbies. The problem I have found is, often times the apps 
            and websites created for outdoorsman, aren't created by outdoorsman.
        </p>
        <p> I began this journey with Thinkful to hopefully change that problem. Everyday I learn new 
            and exciting aspects to writing and developing code.
        </p>
        <p> If you are looking for someone with real world experience in many outdoor related topics
            to add that touch of realism to your new application or website I would be more than happy to help!
